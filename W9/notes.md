# Notes for flask python web app
# Course note for CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

- `GET` is the default method when I am typing a link in a browser. 
- `POST` is from the button or the developer. It can hide information from the browser history using an envelope. 
- `inspect element` can be used to see the more details of the request. One can check the payload option for what variables being sent to the server. 
- `requests.args.get()` is used to get the value of the variable in the URL. `requests.form.get()` is used to get the value of the variable in the form.


- `flask --app app.py --debug run` is used to run the app in debug mode.
