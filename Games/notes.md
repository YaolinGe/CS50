# Games development

## Love2D
- `love.load()` is called once at the beginning of the game.
- `love.update(dt)` is called every frame with `dt` being the time since the last frame.
- `love.draw()` is called every frame after `love.update(dt)`. 


## Game collision detection 
- `AABB` collision detection is the simplest form of collision detection. It checks if two rectangles are overlapping.
